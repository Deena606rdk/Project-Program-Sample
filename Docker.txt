1. Introduction to containers ( In order to learn Docker we need know about containers )


Containerization

-->bulit
-->ship 
-->run anywhere

				so, what is containerization?

Containerization is a lightweight virtualization technology kind alternative to hypervisor

				Main Advantages of containers..

---->containers are isolated. it donent require any operating system...it will run on host kernals.we can create more containers in single
 docker.if one application crashes, other will keep on running..without any issues

--->it portable and lightweight operating systems. it only required binaries, denpendencies and libraries to run application..
so it can be move anywhere

--->faster and resource efficiency-its very fast to boot , because container are very lightweight and start in less than a secoud,
since the docker ISO file contain only 4MB and they do not required any operating systems.

---> Again resource effciency since container do not required a separate operating system,they use less resource on the host computer..

---> improves scalability and lower cost, by allowing more containers in the environment  without the need for more servers


				so, what is Docker on the containers

Docker is open source platform tool designed to mange the containers, it allow us to bulid the application in a container with 
required libraries,dependencies to run the application, ship the container and run anywhere.

the similer tools like Docker...

#Openshift
#Amazon EKS
#google container engine
#kubernates
#azure kubernates services
